                    <ul>

                            <span>This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully
                                processing it.</span>
                        </li>

                            <span>This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to
                                verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.</span>

                            <span>This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process

                                your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are
                                required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to
                                comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the

                                there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you
                                feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your
                                personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate
                                grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.</span>

                            <span>This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you
                                want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
                                (c) where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend
                                legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your personal information but we need to verify whether we have overriding
                                legitimate grounds to use it.</span>

                        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Request transfer of your personal information</span><br/>
                            <span>Upon your request, we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured,
                                commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided
                                consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Right to withdraw (revoke) consent</span><br/>
                            <span>You may exercise this right where we are relying on consent to process your personal information. However, this will not affect
                                the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able
                                to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact our Privacy Officer. Please also note that the following will apply:
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">No Fee Usually Required</p>
                    <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we my charge a reasonable
                        fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">What We May Need From You</p>
                    <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us to confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
                        exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right
                        to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">Time Limit to Respond</p>
                    <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly
                        complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
